This is my constantly evolving permalink generating plugin for Rails.  Started from building off of acts_as_sluggable () but is hardly recognizable as that any longer.  

Requirements
  Rails 3
  MySQL (or compatible database)*

  *This does not work with SQLite that comes with Rails because it cannot search with regular expressions.
